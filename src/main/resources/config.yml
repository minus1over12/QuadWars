# Because of how the End works, there's no nice way to have it split into quadrants. Because of
# this, the End is not quadrant restricted during the prep phase, and teams can interact with
# each other. The plugin does shut off PvP during prep. If you want to make sure the teams have
# no way of interacting during the prep phase, or if you just want to save the end for the battle
# phase, you can disable access to the End during the prep phase here.
